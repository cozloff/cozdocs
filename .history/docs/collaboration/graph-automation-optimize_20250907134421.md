# Referencing Memos & Documentation

Creating an environment where we encourage creating reference documentation that couples as personal notes within some project management hub would be like Kafka for project managers.

Lead developers like Jimmy wouldn't have to be in so many meetings and he could get more done.

**Jeff Bezos said something like**:

- Meetings should be messy, focusing on complex problems, and that most meetings can just be memos, and that meetings should start with silent reading. Like reading is probably on average about a 5 X boost in information processing productivity than meetings. For someone thats in meetings all day, thats like getting all your work done on Monday. And I'm not sure if you intended this google doc to be used in that way.
