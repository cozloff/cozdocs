# Read first, Talk second

**Jeff Bezos said something like**:

- Meetings should be messy, focusing on complex problems
- Most meetings can just be memos.
- Meetings should start with silent reading.

### Why?

- Most times I don't know what I'm even talking about, how can we expect others to understand.
- Organize thoughts better.
- Real-time data sync empowers project managers to organize and prioritize what to share.
- Reading can 5X information processing productivity over meetings.
- Lead developers like Jimmy wouldn't have to be in so many meetings and he could get more done.
