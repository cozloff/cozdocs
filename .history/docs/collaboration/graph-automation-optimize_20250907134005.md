# Software Project Management

## Reference Documentation as a Productivity Multiplier

Creating an environment where reference documentation doubles as **personal notes** inside a project management hub can be transformative.  
For project managers, this setup works almost like _Kafka_—a system that coordinates and empowers, amplifying every person’s effort without adding overhead.

For lead developers like **Jimmy**, it means fewer meetings and more focused time to get work done.

## Rethinking Meetings

Jeff Bezos once framed meetings like this:

- **Most meetings should be memos**: written narratives that clarify thinking up front.
- **Meetings should start with silent reading**: give everyone a chance to absorb before debate.
- **Messy meetings are fine—if they focus on complex problems**, not status updates.

## Why Reading Beats Meetings

Reading is, on average, a **5× boost in information processing productivity** compared to live discussions.

For someone stuck in meetings all day, that’s like getting a full week’s work done by Monday—simply by shifting from synchronous talking to asynchronous reading.

## The Intent of This Document

It’s worth clarifying:  
This Google Doc may not have been intended for that use—but **turning it into a living reference** could dramatically reduce meeting load, unlock productivity, and create more space for solving hard problems instead of repeating information.
