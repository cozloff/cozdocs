# Read first, Talk second

If we encourage creating reference documentation that couples as personal notes within some project management hub:

- Kafka-like empowerment for project managers.
- 5X information processing productivity than meetings.

Lead developers like Jimmy wouldn't have to be in so many meetings and he could get more done.

**Jeff Bezos said something like**:

- Meetings should be messy, focusing on complex problems
- Most meetings can just be memos, and meetings should start with silent reading.

#### Reasoning:

Reading is probably on average a 5X information processing productivity than meetings. For someone thats in meetings all day, thats like getting all your work done on Monday. And I'm not sure if you intended this google doc to be used in that way.
