## 🌐 My Focus Areas

:::tip
I don’t just write code — I **design systems**.  
This hub brings together insights from **application development, cloud-native architectures, security engineering, DevOps, and AI research**.

## 📚 Featured Papers

Here are some of my recent deep dives:

- 🔑 [ASP.NET + Graph API — Fastest Entra Automation](./entra/graph-automation-optimize)  
  How I optimized Microsoft Entra **Graph API** calls with batching, parallelization, and a reusable identity microservice.

- 🔒 [MSAL Node + Redis — Token Cache & Session Management](./redis-session-management)  
  How I built a **Redis-backed MSAL cache** for secure, distributed authentication across multi-tenant container apps.

- ⚙️ [Terraform + Azure — Full Infrastructure Automation](./terraform/)  
  Standardized Terraform modules with remote state, enabling **global infra provisioning** from scratch.

## 🧑‍💻 About My Work

I specialize in building **scalable, secure, and observable systems** at the intersection of:

- **Cloud Infrastructure** (Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform)
- **Identity & Access Management** (Microsoft Entra, Graph API, MSAL)
- **Application Engineering** (C#, .NET, Node.js, distributed microservices)
- **Personal Projects** (HFT Transformer AI, Nutrition Optimizer, and Logistics Social Media)
